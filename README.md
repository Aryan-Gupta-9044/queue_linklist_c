# queue_linklist_c
This project implements a queue using a linked list in C. It provides a simple text-based interface for performing standard queue operations, including enqueue (add to the end), dequeue (remove from the front), and display (print all elements).

## Features

- **Enqueue**: Add a new element to the end of the queue.
- **Dequeue**: Remove and display the element at the front of the queue.
- **Display**: Print all elements of the queue from front to rear.
- **Exit**: Terminate the program.

## Files

- `queue.c`: Contains the main implementation of the queue using a linked list.
- `queue.h`: (Optional) Header file if you want to separate declarations from definitions.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Compilation

To compile the program, use a C compiler like `gcc`. Run the following command in the terminal:

```sh
gcc -o queue queue.c
